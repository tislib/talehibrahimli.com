## My Work

I'm passionate about creating tools and solutions that help developers build better software. Below you'll find information about my projects and open source contributions.

## Projects

### [ApiBrew](https://apibrew.io)

ApiBrew is a SaaS tool for creating CRUD APIs with minimal effort. It allows developers to:

- Define data models and automatically generate REST APIs
- Handle authentication, authorization, and data validation
- Scale seamlessly with your application needs
- Deploy to cloud or on-premises environments

ApiBrew significantly reduces the time and effort required to build backend services, allowing teams to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.

## Open Source

### [ApiBrew Core](http://github.com/apibrew/apibrew)

The core of ApiBrew is open source and available on GitHub. This project provides the foundation for the SaaS offering while allowing developers to:

- Self-host their own instance of ApiBrew
- Contribute to the development of the platform
- Customize the solution for specific needs
- Integrate with other open source tools and frameworks

### [Logi](https://github.com/tislib/logi)

Logi is a language for abstraction that allows developers to define systems declaratively. It enables you to:

- Create custom domain-specific languages (DSLs) for your specific systems
- Define complex systems with minimal effort using a declarative approach
- Compile Logi definitions to JSON for use in your applications
- Use the Logi Virtual Machine to load, read, and execute Logi content

Logi is designed to be simple, flexible, and extensible, making it ideal for creating DSLs for various domains such as credit rules, chatbots, and more.

### [Rapid Api](https://github.com/apibrew/rapid-api)

Rapid Api is a simple API backend tool that allows you to quickly and easily create and use CRUD REST APIs. It enables you to:

- Create, read, update, and delete resources through a straightforward REST interface
- Automatically handle relationships between APIs and sub-resources
- Store data using DynamoDB as the backend database
- Get up and running with minimal configuration

Rapid Api is designed for developers who need to prototype or build backend services quickly without sacrificing functionality or flexibility.

### [Download Delegator](https://github.com/tislib/download-delegator)

Download Delegator is a high concurrent webpage downloader that efficiently processes large batches of web pages. It enables you to:

- Download thousands of web pages concurrently with configurable parameters
- Compress downloaded content using various algorithms to minimize bandwidth usage
- Execute custom JavaScript code on downloaded pages for client-side processing
- Configure network behavior, concurrency limits, and compression settings
- Deploy as AWS Lambda functions for massive parallel processing

Download Delegator is ideal for web scraping, content archiving, and any application requiring efficient batch downloading of web content.
